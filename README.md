## Overview

AskImmigration is designed to make U.S. immigration easier to understand and less overwhelming. It reads and interprets government forms, policy documents, and visa requirements so you can focus on your next step, not paperwork.

Instead of spending hours looking for answers, you can ask a simple question and receive a helpful, plain-language response. From first applications to final decisions, AskImmigration is here to support you throughout your journey.

## Target Audience

- Individuals applying for a visa, green card, or citizenship
- Prospective immigrants planning for visas, green cards, or citizenship
- Families supporting loved ones through the process
- Students, workers, and visitors exploring U.S. immigration options
- Community members and advocates seeking trusted information

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Basic familiarity with Python scripting
- Access to a Groq API key
- Ability to install Python packages via pip

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/okumujustine/AskImmigrate.git
   cd AskImmigrate
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   uv pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Environment Setup

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root.
2. Add your Groq key:
   ```bash
   GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-api-key
   ```
3. Ensure JSON and PDF source files are accessible on disk.

## Usage

### CLI Interface

1. Ingest documents and JSON:
   ```bash
   python embed_documents.py
   ```
2. Launch the terminal chat with a question:
   ```bash
   python cli.py --question "What is the F1 visa?"
   ```
3. List all previous chat sessions:
   ```bash
   python cli.py --list_sessions
   ```
4. Continue a past session (replace \<session\_id> with the ID from list):
   ```bash
   python cli.py --session_id <session_id> --question "Next question text"
   ```

### React Application

1. **Run the back-end server:**
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.api:app --reload --port 9000
   ```
2. Navigate to the `react-app` directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
3. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
5. Open your browser at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to chat with AskImmigrate in the web UI.

## Methodology

1. **Ingestion**: split PDFs and JSON into text chunks
2. **Embedding**: compute embeddings with HuggingFace MiniLM
3. **Indexing**: store embeddings in Chroma vector DB
4. **Prompt Construction**: build system and user prompts via LangChain
5. **Query**: run semantic search + LLM call (Groq) to generate answers

## Performance

- Ingestion: \~100 documents per minute on moderate hardware
- Query: <500â€¯ms per lookup and response on GPU-enabled machine
- Embedding dimension: 768 floats per chunk
